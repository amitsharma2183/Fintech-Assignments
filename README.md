## Overview and Origin

Everyday a new technology is invading the traditional financial market. FinTech is spreading around the world and affecting most of the processes in the sector, including customer service, financial advice, payments and transactions, lending, insurance services and account management.  This revolution in  financial technology has opened new avenues and branches in financial sector.

Mogo is one such example of technology revolution in the lending domain. Mogo Inc. is a Vancouver-based FinTech. It was founded by brothers David and Gregory Feller in 2003. There is little information on how the idea of the company was formed by Feller brothers but it started with focus on easing the problem of credit card debt. It accomplished the task by providing transparent and simple personal loans. Mogo built on the concept of fast and easy loan with the strategic use of technology to achieve their aim. Mogo is currently offering personal loans, identity fraud protection, mortgages, a prepaid Visa debit card, and a bitcoin exchange.

Mogo raised several venture capital rounds in 2014 (Series C in December, backed by Difference Capital). Mogo completed its IPO on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2015, with total proceeds of C$50m. In June 2017, Mogo publicly issued $15m convertible debentures and also secured an additional $40m from Fortress Investment Group in September, 2017.
