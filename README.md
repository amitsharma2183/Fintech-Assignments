## Overview and Origin

Everyday a new technology is invading the traditional financial market. FinTech is spreading around the world and affecting most of the processes in the sector, including customer service, financial advice, payments and transactions, lending, insurance services and account management.  This revolution in  financial technology has opened new avenues and branches in financial sector. Mogo is one such example of technology revolution in the lending domain. 

Mogo Inc. is a Vancouver-based FinTech. It was founded by brothers ***David and Gregory Feller*** in 2003. There is little information on how the idea of the company was formed by Feller brothers but it started with focus on easing the problem of credit card debt. It accomplished the task by providing transparent and simple personal loans. Mogo built on the concept of fast and easy loan with the strategic use of technology to achieve their aim. Mogo is currently offering personal loans, identity fraud protection, mortgages, a prepaid Visa debit card, and a bitcoin exchange.

Mogo is leveraging Plaid’s API technology to enable more convenient access to its products and help more people more easily gain control of their financial health.

Mogo relies on a unique combination of data analysis to analyze loan applications and uses roughly 1,000 data points to gather a detailed snapshot of the borrower.

The application software delves into information received from credit bureaus, what phone the user is connected to, and IP addresses. Search history, Facebook friends, and how you interact with your social network are also all used in allowing Mogo to identify lending opportunities.



## Landscape

Mogo, a Fintech lender, employs the latest financial technologies to streamline the traditionally out-of-date and non-transparent lending process. Not only has fintech given Mogo the power to speed up their payment processing times and de-mystify their policies, but it has also given it the ability to offer personalized experiences based on each loan and mortgage seeker’s needs.

Financial technology, or fintech, companies’ innovative strategies for lending have created unique opportunities for investors and financial institutions. But financial innovation can also create heightened sensitivity for investors, regulators and the broader market. Market reactions to recent operational breakdowns at a fintech company, which included the knowledgeable sale of loans that did not meet investor criteria, exemplified the magnitude of impact an operational breakdown at a company, regardless of asset quality, can have on the wider industry.

Fintech lendiing has seen innovations stimulating their growth. 

1. Using data and psychometrics to assess creditworthiness

2. Deploying accounting integration to provide invoice financing for short term needs

3. Harnessing AI to transform lending into a long-term partnership

4. Creating an added value ecosystem to support SME customers

5. Building ongoing relationships through a membership model

6. Linking repayments to real world performance

## Results


Performance based on metrics for Mogo:

* Core revenue2 increased by 7% to $12.2 million, compared with $11.3 million in the same period in 2019. Revenue was $13.9 million, a decrease of 7% compared to $14.9 million in the same period last year.
* Adjusted EBITDA1 was $0.5 million, compared with $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2019. This decrease is primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in provision for loan losses in Q1 2020 as a result of COVID-19. This provision is not the result of any significant increase in COVID-19 related defaults to date, but rather an upfront provision recognized for potential future losses on the existing book as at March 31, 2020, giving weight to the possibility that the economic conditions surrounding COVID-19 worsen or persist longer than expected.
* Adjusted cash net loss1 for Q1 2020 was ($5.2) million, an increase of 32% compared to ($4.0) million in the same period last year. Net loss was ($10.1) million, compared with ($5.0) million in the same period in 2019.
* At March 31, 2020, the Company had $25.5 million in combined cash and investment portfolio ($6.5 million of Cash and $19.0 million investment portfolio).


## Competition

Mogo's has created a niche for itself in the FinTech lnding domain. Since, technology creates changes which in turn create competition.

Major competitors of Mogo are 

* Crediit Sesame
* Credit Karma
* Quizzle
* First Access
* Borrowell


## Recommendations

Rapid advancement of technology and a new breed of entrepreneurs with keen interest and understanding of finance, have brought about fintech. One more important aspect that has boosted innovation in this industry is the thought of improving customer experience and catering to various borrower pain-points. These were rarely serviced by traditional banks. The gaps observed by fintech pioneers led to an ever-expanding lending market catering to the specific needs of smaller borrowers.

Mogo has been trying to create the space in lenidng domain. Here's some recommendations for Mogo to consider especially looking at the everchanging dynamic FinTech space.

* consolidation, as established firms seek to enter new markets, increase their customer base and build scale;
* a quicker exit time from initial venture-capital funding;
* blurring boundaries between fintech fins and more traditional banks (eg., obtaining approval for some banking services, obtaining a banking license, acquiring minority stake
of a bank), and
* evolving and merging of lending space with other domains like payments.

#### Rationale for Recommendations

 All over the world, fintech leaders (particularly fintech fin leaders) are increasingly interested in the potential benefits of integration with the larger financial system. Through such transactions, Mogo can seek to improve its financial viability, attract more clients and, create an opportunity to obtain guarantees for deposits. Mogo can hope to play to  its strengths, including the ability to offer an enhanced user experience and utilize advanced credit models, and take advantage of the flexible regulatory framework in which it operate. 

Mogo has shown significant profits, and the path to profitability is not guaranteed. The only thing guaranteed is the evolution of the FinTech. Bigger financial institutions like Bank will be either lokking to work in collaboration with FinTech companies or they will invest to build their own technology framework. Therefore, it will be imperative for Mogo to look for foray into other domains like digital wallet, payment gateweays etc.

These kinds of explorations will signal Mogo's desire to survive on their own and avoid threats such as customer fraud, cybersecurity and privacy breaches, and low profitability. 


#### Opportunity for Mogo

Traditional lenders like banks’ revenues at risk from fintech competition are typically in the range of 2 to 3 percent from lower loan origination, lower net income, and fewer customers acquired. Banks can gain a potential 3 to 5 percent in revenues by collaborating with fintechs, through enhanced customer acquisition, more feebased revenues, better pricing accuracy, and lower cost of risk. 

Also, till now FinTech domains are involved in catering to their niches. There are already many competitors for Mogo providing somewhat similar products and services with technology as their key weapon. For  Mogo to survive the onslaught of competitors like Banks looking for technology upgradation and changing atmosphere post Covid, Mogo has to think about foraying into other domains.
